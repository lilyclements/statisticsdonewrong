<p>Until now, I have presumed that scientists are capable of making statistical
computations with perfect accuracy, and only err in their choice of appropriate
numbers to compute. Scientists may misuse the results of statistical tests or
fail to make relevant computations, but they can at least calculate a <em>p</em> value,
right?</p>
<p>Perhaps not.</p>
<p id="index-0">Surveys of statistically significant results reported in medical and
psychological trials suggest that many <em>p</em> values are wrong, and some
statistically insignificant results are actually significant when computed
correctly.<span class="citation"><sup><a class="reference internal" href="zbibliography.html#citation-gotzsche-2006du">25</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup><a class="reference internal" href="zbibliography.html#citation-bakker-2011ja">2</a></sup></span> Other reviews find examples
of misclassified data, erroneous duplication of data, inclusion of the wrong
dataset entirely, and other mixups, all concealed by papers which did not
describe their analysis in enough detail for the errors to be easily noticed.<span class="citation"><sup><a class="reference internal" href="zbibliography.html#citation-baggerly-2009gk">1</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup><a class="reference internal" href="zbibliography.html#citation-gotzsche-1989uy">26</a></sup></span></p>
<p>Sunshine is the best disinfectant, and many scientists have called for
experimental data to be made available through the Internet. In some fields,
this is now commonplace: there exist gene sequencing databases, protein
structure databanks, astronomical observation databases, and earth observation
collections containing the contributions of thousands of scientists. Many other
fields, however, can’t share their data due to impracticality (particle physics
data can include many terabytes of information), privacy issues (in medical
trials), a lack of funding or technological support, or just a desire to keep
proprietary control of the data and all the discoveries which result from
it. And even if the data were all available, would anyone analyze it all to spot
errors?</p>
<p id="index-1">Similarly, scientists in some fields have pushed towards making their
statistical analyses available through clever technological tools. A tool called
Sweave, for instance, makes it easy to embed statistical analyses performed
using the popular R programming language inside papers written in LaTeX, the
standard for scientific and mathematical publications. The result looks just
like any scientific paper, but another scientist reading the paper and curious
about its methods can download the source code, which shows exactly how all the
numbers were calculated. But would scientists avail themselves of the
opportunity?  Nobody gets scientific glory by checking code for typos.</p>
<p>Another solution might be <span class="target" id="index-2"></span>replication. If scientists carefully recreate
the experiments of other scientists and validate their results, it is much
easier to rule out the possibility of a typo causing an errant
result. Replication also weeds out fluke false positives. Many scientists claim
that experimental replication is the heart of science: no new idea is accepted
until it has been independently tested and retested around the world and found
to hold water.</p>
<p>That’s not entirely true; scientists often take previous studies for granted,
though occasionally scientists decide to systematically re-test earlier
works. One new project, for example, aims to reproduce papers in major
psychology journals to determine just how many papers hold up over time – and
what attributes of a paper predict how likely it is to stand up to
retesting.<a class="footnote-reference" href="#reproducibility" id="id1">[1]</a> In another example, cancer researchers at Amgen
retested 53 landmark preclinical studies in cancer research. (By “preclinical” I
mean the studies did not involve human patients, as they were testing new and
unproven ideas.) Despite working in collaboration with the authors of the
original papers, the Amgen researchers could only reproduce six of the studies.<span class="citation"><sup><a class="reference internal" href="zbibliography.html#citation-begley-2012">5</a></sup></span> Bayer researchers have reported similar difficulties when
testing potential new drugs found in published papers.<span class="citation"><sup><a class="reference internal" href="zbibliography.html#citation-prinz-2011gb">49</a></sup></span></p>
<p>This is worrisome. Does the trend hold true for less speculative kinds of
medical research? Apparently so: of the top-cited research articles in medicine,
a quarter have gone untested after their publication, and a third have been
found to be exaggerated or wrong by later research.<span class="citation"><sup><a class="reference internal" href="zbibliography.html#citation-ioannidis-2005gy">32</a></sup></span>
That’s not as extreme as the Amgen result, but it makes you wonder what
important errors still lurk unnoticed in important research. Replication is not
as prevalent as we would like it to be, and the results are not always
favorable.</p>
