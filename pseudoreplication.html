<p>Many studies strive to collect more data through replication: by repeating their
measurements with additional patients or samples, they can be more certain of
their numbers and discover subtle relationships that aren’t obvious at first
glance. We’ve seen the value of additional data for improving statistical power
and detecting small differences. But what exactly counts as a replication?</p>
<p>Let’s return to a medical example. I have two groups of 100 patients taking
different medications, and I seek to establish which medication lowers blood
pressure more. I have each group take the medication for a month to allow it to
take effect, and then I follow each group for ten days, each day testing their
blood pressure. I now have ten data points per patient and 1,000 data points per
group.</p>
<p>Brilliant! 1,000 data points is quite a lot, and I can fairly easily establish
whether one group has lower blood pressure than the other. When I do
calculations for statistical significance I find significant results very
easily.</p>
<p>But wait: we expect that taking a patient’s blood pressure ten times will yield
ten very similar results. If one patient is genetically predisposed to low blood
pressure, I have counted his genetics ten times. Had I collected data from 1,000
independent patients instead of repeatedly testing 100, I would be more
confident that differences between groups came from the medicines and not from
genetics and luck. I claimed a large sample size, giving me statistically
significant results and high statistical power, but my claim is unjustified.</p>
<p>This problem is known as pseudoreplication, and it is quite common.<span class="citation"><sup><a class="reference internal" href="zbibliography.html#citation-lazic-2010fc">38</a></sup></span> After testing cells from a culture, a biologist might
“replicate” his results by testing more cells from the same
culture. Neuroscientists will test multiple neurons from the same animal,
incorrectly claiming they have a large sample size because they tested hundreds
of neurons from just two rats.</p>
<p>In statistical terms, pseudoreplication occurs when individual observations are
heavily dependent on each other. Your measurement of a patient’s blood pressure
will be highly related to his blood pressure yesterday, and your measurement of
soil composition here will be highly correlated with your measurement five feet
away. There are several ways to account for this dependence while performing
your statistical analysis:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Average the dependent data points. For example, average all the blood
pressure measurements taken from a single person. This isn’t perfect, though;
if you measured some patients more frequently than others, this won’t be
reflected in the averaged number. You want a method that somehow counts
measurements as more reliable as more are taken.</li>
<li>Analyze each dependent data point separately. You could perform an analysis
of every patient’s blood pressure on day 5, giving you only one data point per
person. But be careful, because if you do this for every day, you’ll have
problems with <a class="reference internal" href="p-value.html#multiple-comparisons"><span class="std std-ref">multiple comparisons</span></a>, which we
will discuss in the next chapter.</li>
<li>Use a statistical model which accounts for the dependence, like a
hierarchical model or random effects model.</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s important to consider each approach before analyzing your data, as each
method is suited to different situations. Pseudoreplication makes it easy to
achieve significance, even though it gives you little additional information on
the test subjects. Researchers must be careful not to artificially inflate their
sample sizes when they retest samples.</p>
