  <title>Everybody Makes Mistakes</title>

  <p>
    Statistical errors are not limited to a few careless researchers <mdash/>
    they are pervasive across disciplines. Studies of published research
    find errors in a substantial fraction of papers, from simple arithmetic
    mistakes to fundamental conceptual misunderstandings.
  </p>

  <p>
    Errors arise from many sources: inadequate training, software bugs,
    copy-and-paste mistakes, and the pressure to produce significant results.
    Even careful researchers make mistakes, and the peer review process
    is not reliable enough to catch them all.
  </p>

  <p>
    This chapter catalogues common statistical errors found in the literature
    and discusses what can be done to reduce their frequency.
