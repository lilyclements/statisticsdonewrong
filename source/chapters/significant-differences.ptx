  <title>When Differences in Significance Aren't Significant Differences</title>

  <p>
    A common error in scientific reasoning is to compare the statistical
    significance of two results and draw conclusions from the comparison.
    If result A is statistically significant and result B is not, researchers
    often conclude that A and B are different from each other.
  </p>

  <p>
    This reasoning is flawed. The difference between significant and
    not significant is not itself statistically significant. Two results
    may both be compatible with the same underlying effect, or may
    represent genuinely different effects <mdash/> but you cannot tell
    simply by comparing their <em>p</em> values.
  </p>

  <p>
    This chapter explores the correct way to compare results and effect
    sizes, and the dangers of treating significance as a binary category.
