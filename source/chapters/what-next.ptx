  <title>What Can Be Done?</title>

  <p>
    The situation is not hopeless. Statisticians, methodologists, and
    enlightened scientists have proposed many reforms to improve the quality
    of scientific research. Some have already been implemented; others
    are gaining traction.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pre-registration, larger sample sizes, open data, replication studies,
    better statistical education, and revised publication standards can all
    contribute to a more reliable scientific literature. None of these
    changes is easy or free, but the alternative <mdash/> continuing to
    build science on a shaky foundation <mdash/> is worse.
  </p>

  <p>
    This chapter surveys the reforms that have been proposed and evaluates
    their prospects for improving scientific practice.
