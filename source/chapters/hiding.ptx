  <title>Hiding the Data</title>

  <p>
    Science is built on transparency. Reproducibility requires that other
    scientists be able to examine the data and methods behind a published
    result. Yet data sharing is far from universal, and there are many ways
    <mdash/> both intentional and accidental <mdash/> that data and methods
    can be hidden from scrutiny.
  </p>

  <p>
    Publication bias means that positive results are far more likely to be
    published than negative ones. Selective reporting means that only some
    of the outcomes measured in a study appear in the final paper.
    Together, these practices create a distorted picture of scientific
    evidence.

  <p>
    This chapter discusses publication bias, selective reporting, data
    sharing, and what the scientific community can do to improve transparency.
