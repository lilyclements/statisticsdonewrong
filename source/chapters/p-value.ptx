  <title>The <em>p</em> Value and the Base Rate Fallacy</title>

  <p>
    The <em>p</em> value is one of the most widely used and widely misunderstood
    concepts in statistics. A <em>p</em> value is the probability of obtaining
    results at least as extreme as those observed, given that the null
    hypothesis is true.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is <em>not</em> the probability that your results occurred by chance, and
    it is <em>not</em> the probability that the null hypothesis is true. These
    common misinterpretations lead to the base rate fallacy: ignoring the
    prior probability that a hypothesis is true when evaluating evidence.
  </p>

  <p>
    This chapter explores what <em>p</em> values really mean, how they are
    commonly misinterpreted, and what consequences these misinterpretations
    have for scientific practice.
