  <title>Statistical Power and Underpowered Statistics</title>

  <p>
    Statistical power is the ability of a study to detect an effect when one
    actually exists. An underpowered study is one that is unlikely to detect
    an effect even when it is real.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many studies in the scientific literature are dramatically underpowered.
    They do not have enough subjects to reliably detect effects of the size
    they are looking for, meaning that a negative result is nearly meaningless.
    Yet negative results are just as important as positive ones for building
    a complete picture of scientific knowledge.
  </p>

  <p>
    This chapter explores what statistical power means, how to compute it,
    and what the consequences are of running underpowered studies.
