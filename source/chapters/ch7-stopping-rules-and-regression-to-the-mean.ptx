  <title>Stopping Rules and Regression to the Mean</title>

  <p>
    When should you stop collecting data? If you analyze your data as you
    collect it and stop when you achieve statistical significance, you will
    dramatically inflate your false positive rate. This is known as optional
    stopping, and it is a subtle but serious problem in scientific research.
  </p>

  <p>
    Related to this is regression to the mean: extreme measurements tend to
    be followed by less extreme ones, simply because of random variation.
    A patient who scores very low on a test will likely score higher the
    next time <mdash/> not because of any treatment, but because their first
    score was unusually low.

  <p>
    This chapter discusses stopping rules, regression to the mean, and
    how to avoid being fooled by these phenomena.
