  <title>Introduction</title>

  <p>
    In the final chapter of his famous book <em>How to Lie with Statistics</em>,
    Darrell Huff tells us that <q>anything smacking of the medical profession</q>
    or published by scientific laboratories and universities is worthy of
    our trust. After all, Huff filled an entire book with the misleading
    statistical trickery used in politics and the media, but few people complain
    about statistics done by trained professional scientists.

    Statistical data analysis is fundamental to science. Open a random page
    in your favorite medical journal and you'll be deluged with statistics:
    <em>t</em> tests, <em>p</em> values, proportional hazards models, risk ratios,
    logistic regressions, least-squares fits, and confidence intervals.
    Statisticians have provided scientists with tools of enormous power to
    find order and meaning in the most complex of datasets, and scientists
    have embraced them with glee.
  </p>

  <p>
    They have not, however, embraced statistics <em>education</em>, and many
    undergraduate programs in the sciences require no statistical training
    whatsoever.

  <p>
    What follows is a list of the more egregious statistical fallacies
    regularly committed in the name of science. It assumes no knowledge of
    statistical methods, since many scientists receive no formal statistical
    training. And be warned: once you learn the fallacies, you will see them
    <em>everywhere.</em>
