  <title>Conclusion</title>

  <p>
    Beware false confidence. You may soon develop a smug sense of
    satisfaction that <em>your</em> work doesn't screw up like everyone else's. But
    this guide has not given you a thorough introduction to the mathematics of
    data analysis. There are many ways to foul up statistics beyond these
    simple conceptual errors.
  </p>

  <p>
    Errors will occur often, because somehow, few undergraduate science
    degrees or medical schools require courses in statistics and
    experimental design. This is seen as acceptable despite the paramount
    role of data and statistical analysis in the pursuit of modern science.
    Scientists need formal statistical training and advice.
  </p>

  <p>
    Change will not be easy. Rigorous statistical standards don't come free:
    if scientists start routinely performing statistical power computations,
    for example, they'll soon discover they need vastly larger sample sizes
    to reach solid conclusions. But isn't it worse to build our progress
    on a foundation of unsound results?
  </p>

  <p>
    To any science students: invest in a statistics course or two while you
    have the chance. To researchers: invest in training, a good book, and
    statistical advice.
