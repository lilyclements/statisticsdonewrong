  <title>Researcher Freedom: Good Vibrations?</title>

  <p>
    Scientists make dozens of small decisions when designing and analyzing
    experiments: which participants to exclude, which outcomes to measure,
    when to stop collecting data, which covariates to include. Each of these
    decisions is a degree of freedom that can be exploited, consciously or
    not, to obtain a desired result.
  </p>

  <p>
    This <q>researcher degrees of freedom</q> problem means that many published
    findings reflect the choices made during analysis as much as they reflect
    the underlying reality. Even well-meaning scientists can fool themselves
    into finding false results if they are not careful.
  </p>

  <p>
    This chapter examines how researcher freedom operates, how it inflates
    false positive rates, and what practices can constrain it.
