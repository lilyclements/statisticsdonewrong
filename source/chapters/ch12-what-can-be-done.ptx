  <title>What Can Be Done?</title>
 <introduction>
  <p>
    I've discussed many statistical problems throughout this guide. They
    appear in many fields of science: medicine, physics, climate science,
    biology, chemistry, neuroscience, and many others. Any researcher using
    statistical methods to analyze data is likely to make a mistake, and as
    we've seen, most of them do. What can we do about it?
  </p>

    <title>Statistical Education</title>

    <p>
      Most American science students have a minimal statistical education
      <mdash/> perhaps one or two required courses, or even none at all for
      many students. And even when students have taken statistical courses,
      professors report that they can't apply statistical concepts to
      scientific questions, having never fully understood <mdash/> or simply
      forgotten <mdash/> the appropriate techniques. This needs to change.
      Almost every scientific discipline depends on statistical analysis of
      experimental data, and statistical errors waste grant funding and
      researcher time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some universities have experimented with statistics courses integrated
      with science classes, with students immediately applying their
      statistical knowledge to problems in their field. Preliminary results
      suggests these methods work: students learn and retain more statistics,
      and they spend less time whining about being forced to take a
      statistics course.<fn>A. M. Metz. Teaching Statistics in Biology:
      Using Inquiry-based Learning to Strengthen Understanding of
      Statistical Analysis in Biology Laboratory Courses. <em>CBE Life
      Sciences Education</em>, 7:317<ndash/>326, 2008.</fn> More
      universities should adopt these techniques, using conceptual tests to
      see what methods work best.
    </p>

    <p>
      We also need more freely available educational material. I was
      introduced to statistics when I needed to analyze data in a laboratory
      and didn't know how; until strong statistics education is more
      widespread, many students will find themselves in the same position,
      and they need resources. Projects like
      <url href="http://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php"
      visual="openintro.org/stat/textbook.php">OpenIntro Stats</url><fn>PreTeXt versions are available at
      <url href="https://pretextbooks.github.io/openintro-statistics/frontmatter.html"
      visual="pretextbooks.github.io/openintro-statistics/frontmatter.html">OpenIntro Statistics</url> and
      <url href="https://pretextbooks.github.io/ims/welcome.html"
      visual="pretextbooks.github.io/ims/welcome.html">Introduction to Modern Statistics</url>.</fn> are
      promising, and I hope to see more in the near future.

    <p>
      Scientific journals are slowly making progress towards solving many of
      the problems I have discussed. Reporting guidelines, such as CONSORT
      for randomized trials, make it clear what information is required for
      a published paper to be reproducible; unfortunately, as we've seen,
      these guidelines are infrequently enforced. We must continue to
      pressure journals to hold authors to more rigorous standards.
    </p>

    <p>
      Premier journals need to lead the charge. <em>Nature</em> has begun
      to do so, announcing a new
      <url href="http://www.nature.com/authors/policies/checklist.pdf"
      visual="nature.com/authors/policies/checklist.pdf">checklist</url>
      which authors are required to complete before articles may be
      published. The checklist requires reporting of sample sizes,
      statistical power calculations, clinical trial registration numbers,
      a completed CONSORT checklist, adjustment for multiple comparisons,
      and sharing of data and source code. The guidelines cover most issues
      covered in <em>Statistics Done Wrong</em>, except for <xref ref="ch-regression">stopping rules</xref>
      and discussion of any reasons for departing from the trial's
      registered <xref ref="ch-freedom">protocol</xref>. <em>Nature</em> will also make statisticians
      available to consult for papers as needed.
    </p>

    <p>
      If these guidelines are enforced, the result will be much more
      reliable and reproducible scientific research. More journals should
      do the same.

    <title>Your Job</title>

    <p>
      Your task can be expressed in four simple steps:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Read a statistics textbook or take a good statistics course.
        Practice.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Plan your data analyses carefully and deliberately, avoiding the
        misconceptions and errors you have learned.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>When you find common errors in the scientific literature <mdash/>
        such as a simple misinterpretation of <em>p</em> values <mdash/>
        hit the perpetrator over the head with your statistics textbook.
        It's therapeutic.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Press for change in scientific education and publishing. It's
        our research. Let's not screw it up.</p>
      </li>
