  <title>What Have We Wrought?</title>

  <p>
    The statistical errors described in this book are not rare edge cases.
    They are widespread, and their consequences are serious. Entire fields
    of science may be built on shaky statistical foundations, with many
    published findings that cannot be replicated.
  </p>

  <p>
    Several high-profile replication failures have called into question
    the reliability of published scientific research. When researchers
    attempt to replicate well-known findings, they often fail <mdash/>
    sometimes dramatically so.
  </p>

  <p>
    This chapter surveys what we know about the state of scientific
    reproducibility and discusses the consequences for science and society.
