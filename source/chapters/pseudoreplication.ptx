  <title>Pseudoreplication: Choose Your Data Wisely</title>

  <p>
    Pseudoreplication occurs when measurements are not truly independent of
    each other but are treated as though they are. This inflates the apparent
    sample size and leads to overconfident conclusions.
  </p>

  <p>
    A classic example: if you measure the same mouse ten times, you do not
    have ten independent data points. You have one mouse with ten measurements.
    Treating these as ten independent observations grossly exaggerates your
    statistical power and the certainty of your conclusions.

  <p>
    This chapter discusses how pseudoreplication arises, how to recognize it,
    and how to design studies that avoid it.
