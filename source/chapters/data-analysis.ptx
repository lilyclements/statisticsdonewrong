  <title>An Introduction to Data Analysis</title>

  <p>
    Much of experimental science comes down to measuring changes. Does one
    medicine work better than another? Do cells with one version of a gene
    synthesize more of an enzyme than cells with another version? Does one
    kind of signal processing algorithm detect pulsars better than another?
    Is one catalyst more effective at speeding a chemical reaction than
    another?
  </p>

  <p>
    Much of statistics, then, comes down to making judgments about these
    kinds of differences. We talk about <q>statistically significant
    differences</q> because statisticians have devised ways of telling if the
    difference between two measurements is really big enough to ascribe to
    anything but chance.
  </p>

  <p>
    We will explore what these methods mean and how to use them correctly,
    along with the common pitfalls that await the unwary scientist.
